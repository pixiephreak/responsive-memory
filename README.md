# responsive-memory
## The game of memory built using javascript and imgs of Prince and the Twitter Bootstrap framework (and React and jQuery).

The original version of this project was written in vanilla JavaScript as part of Colleen Van Lent's Responsive Design course through The University of Michigan on Coursera.

Every time I learn a new technology, I refactor the game code.

See the branches to check out each implementation.
So far I've implemented using:
..*1.React
2.jQuery
